            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>In this project, called "Choose Your Own Adventure", we got to choose an adventure we found interesting. We were partenered with someone who chose the same adventure as us. My partner was Jacob and our adventure was a "Portal to Anywhere".</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>We made a story beginning with the appearance of a portal in your room. You then have two options: enter the portal or go back to sleep. Whichever you choose will take you to another part of the story. If you enter, you go to another place with different options. If you return to sleep, you will proceed to a dream in which another portal appears. There will be different outcomes and endings depending on which options you choose. Most of them don't end well, but there are only two paths that lead to your survival.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <h4>Purpose</h4>
            <p>The main reason our teacher, Mr. Mueller, assigned this project was to help us improve our skills and our comprehension of Git and Github. Some major skills required to complete this project were collaboration and communication. We had to work together and share ideas. The overall purpose was to practice collaboration through Github. We had to merge our commits by pushing and pulling them, trying our best to avoid merge conflicts.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>Something that we had trouble with was getting started. We were a little confused about how we were supposed to make and organize the files for the adventure. After looking at an example of what the project could or should look like and asking Mr. Mueller, we were able to complete our project. We deleted the folders and files we created in order to be organized and made new files inside two folders, which are the first two options of the adventure.</p>
            <h4>Takeaways & Next Steps</h4>
            <p>Something I need to improve on is communicating. Not being in constant communication with my partner led to other minor issues. In the future, I will try my best to communicate more often. If I had more time, I might have tried using HTML files instead of .md files to make the adventure more appealing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication is key to completing tasks and minimizing the possibility of mistakes.</li>
                <li>Planning before getting started will make things go smoother and help you finish quicker.</li>
                <li>Staying organized is also vital because it will help you know where things are and access them quicker.</li>
            </ul>
